    <strong>How to Write The Appeal:</strong><br>Write the appeal in <a href="https://blankslate.io">Blank Slate</a> and when you are done, click save in the bottom right corner and continue as a guest. Click share note in the top right and a URL will be copied to your clipboard. go to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/LilJuiceBox491/#comments">This Link</a> and say that you wrote an unban appeal and give the link. Your appeal will be reviewed and we will contact you through Scratch<br><br>
    <b>What moderators look for in an appeal:</b><br>What is looked for in appeals differs depending on the moderator member reviewing it. Some moderators are more lenient, others not so much. Though, the things that matter most in an appeal are honesty, detail, politeness and remorse and past offences.<br><br>moderators will ask themselves two questions when reviewing appeals. These are 'Is the punishment justified?' and most importantly, 'Will they break the rules again (assuming they're guilty)?'<br><br><strong>What moderators <i>don't</i> look for in an appeal:</strong><br>There are a few things that moderators either don't want to see, or don't need to see. For example, they don't want to see lies nor excuses, and they don't need to see irrelevant details and good grammar. In fact, grammar is rarely - if ever - assessed. This is a site for kids; and children are less capable of writing a flawless essay for an appeal. moderators know this, and so will not penalise you for things such as 'spellign' erors, so long as it's clear that you have tried.<br><br><strong>Honesty:</strong><br>Dishonesty is the fastest way to get your appeal denied. You want to be as honest as possible, because lying only suggests that you're not sorry for breaking the rules; you're sorry you got caught breaking the rules. Dishonesty is, after all, synonymous with rule-breaking. Keep in mind moderators probably have evidence of your misdeeds, so lying is often a death sentence for your account. I denied pretty much all dishonest appeals with no second thought, and so will most other moderators. Even if you think a little lie or two will increase your chances, it won't; do not go there.<br><br><strong>Detail:</strong><br>The appealing stage is a very useful opportunity to explain as much of the incident leading up to your punishment as possible; do not waste it.<br>You can only appeal once, so if your account matters to you even a little bit, you should put some effort into it instead of cracking your appeal out in sixty seconds. Simply saying "please unban I didn't do anything wrong smh?" will earn you a ticket to a denied appeal. If staff don't think you care about your account, why would they unban you? If you don't care after all, you're more likely to break the rules. Also, recounting information accurately demonstrates that you're being honest.<br><br><strong>Politeness:</strong><br>Whether you were wrongly banned or otherwise, politeness is essential to getting unbanned. If you cuss out a staff member for banning you, they're not going to be offended. No, they're going to laugh at your appeal, deny it, and probably share it with their co-workers so that they can enjoy it as well. If you're all fired up at the time of writing your appeal, then go to sleep and write it tomorrow instead.<br><br><strong>Remorse and past offences:</strong><br>Remember when I said the most important question the staff ask themselves is 'Will they break the rules again?' Well, if you don't seem remorseful then they're going to conclude that you might break the rules again, and so will not unban you. Something that might be a problem in this regard would be excuses, such as the aforementioned "They swore at me first" example. Staff are unfortunately still human (though the age of the AI is drawing closer), and will understand if you swore or cheated in the heat of a really tense game, because mistakes happen. But, you have to take responsibility for your actions and emphasise that it will not happen again.<br><br><strong>Good grammar:</strong><br>So long as your appeal is coherent, your grammar really doesn't matter too much. Still, having good grammar is a way to show you care about your account and are remorseful, for it shows you've put unnecessary effort into getting its punishment lifted. But again, don't worry about your grammar too much.
